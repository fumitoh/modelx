            mx.stop_stacktrace()

    .. warning:: This function is currently experimental
            and subject to limitations detailed below.

    This function exports the provided ``model`` as a Python package.
    The resulting package is self-contained, meaning it does not require modelx.

    In the resulting package,
    classes are defined to represent the original model and its spaces.
    The cells from the original model are exported
    as methods within these space classes.

    Upon importing the generated package,
    an instance of the model class is created.
    This model can be accessed as ``mx_model``,
    or under the name of the original model within the package's namespace.

    Values of types :obj:`int`, :obj:`str`, and :obj:`float` that are assigned
    to references are output as literals within the package's modules.

    Values associated with PandasData objects are saved in files within the package.
    The metadata from these PandasData objects are output
    as dictionary literals in the *_mx_io.py* module of the package.

    Values not associated with any IOSpec objects
    (except for those of the types listed above) are serialized (pickled)
    and stored in the *_mx_pickled* file within the package.

    **Limitations**

    As this function is currently experimental,
    not all modelx models can be exported. Current limitations include:

    * Relative references in ItemSpaces are not supported.
      All references within an ItemSpace are bound
      to the same objects their base references point to.

    * Objects associated with IOSpec other than PandasData,
      such as ExcelRange and ModuleData, are not supported.

    * modelx coerces a Cells object without parameters to its value
      when used as an operand of arithmetic operators
      (e.g., ``+``, ``-``, ``*``, ``/``).
      This coercion does not occur in the exported models
      and will be deprecated in future modelx releases.
      Users should ensure that such Cells are called using ``()``
      in the original model's formulas.

    Args:
        model: The Model object to be exported.
        path: The path where the generated Python package will be located.
